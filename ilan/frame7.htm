        FOUND IT !</b></font> part 3</font></h2>
      <p><font size="4"><b><font size="5" color="#6600FF">T</font></b>hen the 
        program host asked the viewers to pray this prayer: &quot; Lord Jesus 
        I know that I'm a sinner, I know that you loved me so much you were willing 
        to give your life for me, and you died in order to take my sins away. 
        I ask you to forgive my sins and become lord of my life. I give my life 
        to you. Thank you for forgiving my sins and for becoming lord of my life.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font size="4"><b><font size="5" color="#6600FF">A</font></b>nd so I 
        prayed I had nothing to lose, I didn't feel something happened but I knew 
        and was sure that what I prayed for did happen. I hadn't checked weather 
        the facts were true,I just knew Jesus was the Messiah the son of God, 
        because that's how my mom had influenced me as a child.<br>
        I didn't know what it meant and what it had to do with me, till the day 
        I prayed.<br>
        Later I learned through reading the Bible daily, that the facts were true 
        !</font></p>
      <p><font size="4"><b><font size="5" color="#6600FF">T</font></b>his was 
        and is the greatest treasure I found, a treasure no one can steal nor 
        take away, it never loses it's value or shape, this treasure is for ever 
        and it's the kingdom of heaven by forgiveness of sins. It's the freedom 
        to bring anything in prayer to God knowing that he loves me and cares 
        for me.</font></p>
      <p><font size="4"><b><font size="5" color="#6600FF">I</font></b> don't worry 
        I have a reason to live, to live for his glory and to share about this 
        treasure according to the abilities he's given me.<br>
        I learned to love and to forgive. Some years have past and I'm still changing 
        and still have the hope and the peace of God in my heart till the day 
        I'll be with him in heaven.</font></p>
      <p><font size="5"><b><font color="#6600FF">D</font></b></font><font size="4">uring 
        these years there were some difficulties and failures but God has always 
        put me back on my feet.<br>
        I'm weak and fragile like clay but he is strong !<br>
