      <p><font size="4"><b><font size="5" color="#6600FF">S</font></b>ome time 
        later I started watching a TV program which hadn't seemed interesting 
        before, The 700 Club.<br>
        In this program people speak about their lives and how they were going 
        through very difficult times and situations. They all had one thing in 
        common. They found hope and comfort their lives were changed, some in 
        a very extreme way.<br>
        What made the difference was that some how they gave their lives to a 
        person called Jesus Christ<b><font size="3" color="#3399FF">(</font></b><b><font size="3" color="#3399FF">the 
        word Christ is the </font><font size="3" color="#66CCFF"><font color="#3399FF">equivalent 
        to the Hebrew word Messiah which means anointed priest</font></font><font size="3" color="#3399FF"> 
        and king</font><font size="3" color="#3399FF">)</font></b><font size="4">.</font></font></p>
      <p><font size="4"><b><font size="5" color="#6600FF">T</font></b>he hosts 
        of this TV program would explain that Jesus the son of God, and that almost 
        2000 years ago, he was sent to this world by his father the one who created 
        the world.<br>
        Jesus came to deal with the human problem which is sin. Sin separates 
        our souls from God who is sinless and holy, even after death, and we all 
        sin just look around you. </font></p>
      <p><font size="4"><b><font size="5" color="#6600FF">S</font></b>o Jesus 
        the son of God became a man a sinless man, to be the perfect sacrifice 
        as Old Testament sacrifices were ought to be. Animal sacrifices were temporary 
        and pointed just like many Old Testament prophecies to the first coming 
        of the Messiah, to die as a sacrifice for us, thus taking the punishment 
        we deserve and to pay the price we can't pay, for our sins so that all 
        who believes in him won't be separated from God, now and after death.<br>
        So when we're still here he is with us and we die we go to the best place 
        there is !<br>
        On the third day after Jesus died he rose from the grave, there is no 
        body in the tomb ! 40 days later he went back to his father which is in 
        heaven till the time is right for him to return and be the king of this 
        world.</font></p>
