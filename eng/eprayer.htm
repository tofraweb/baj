The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man avails much
</b><br><FONT face=Arial size=2>
James 5:16
<br><br>
First of all, we must give thanks to our heavenly father for all things. We thank the Lord for the freedom we have in Israel to meet as believers, evangelize the Israeli people and lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty. We also thank the Lord for the Christian literature we have in the Hebrew language. We thank the Lord that today there are more local believers in Israel, and more congregations in many cities, than there were in the establishment of the state of Israel<br><br>

 <b>

The state of Israel</b><br>

Pray that there will peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians and that there will be no more killing. Pray that God would give wisdom to government of Israel and the Palestinians leaders. Pray for peace between Israel and the Arab countries around her.

Pray for the salvation of the people of God, that God would remove the veil, which is on their heart and on their spiritual eyes. Pray also for their morality, they want to become more and more like all the nations instead of seeking the will of God in their lives. Many of the Israelis are charmed by the cults of the east, pray that they will reach the understanding that the truth is the book God gave them<br><br>

 
<b>
The local body of Christ in Israel</b><br>

Pray that the local believers in Israel would a good testimony to the nation of Israel and that God will use us in order to be a light for them. Pray that God will guard the true believers in Israel from false teaching because some “believers” have started to teach that Jesus is not God in the flesh.

Pray that there will be no laws against the gospel. There are orthodox Jewish groups who try to convince the government in Israel to make laws against missionaries. Pray that God will guard all the believers in Israel from those orthodox Jewish groups who try to harm us in different ways<br><br>

 
<b>
The Jaffa assembly</b><br>

Pray that there will be unity in our assembly and that we would stand firm in word of God. Pray for the Israeli people that we share the gospel with. Every week we send many books to people all over Israel and we invite them to our meetings and special events. Pray that God would open the hearts of those who receive the New Testament and other literature. Often we see people come to our assembly, pray that God would touch their hearts and that they would be saved.

Pray that God would raise-up devoted people in our assembly that would serve him in teaching the word, evangelizing and any other role. Every role is important and God needs every believer for his service<br><br>
